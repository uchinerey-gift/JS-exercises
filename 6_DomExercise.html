<!-- JS and the DOM -->

<!-- 
	READ THIS FIRST!

This file is an HTML file. You'll put your JS code for the exercises in a <scipt> tag at the bottom of this file.
Open this file in Google Chrome by opening Chrome, typing command-O, and selecting this file.
Or in Chrome you can use the menu bar by doing File -> Open.
As you add JS code to the file, you can refresh the page and see your code take effect.
You can also type your JS code in the Console tab of Chrome Developer Tools to see it take effect.

Note: Usually you would put your HTML and JS in separate files, but for simplicity we're 
putting them in the same file for this exercise.

Read through the HTML code given, then scroll down to the exercises below.
Type your JavaScript code for each exercise below each exercise description.
For this exercise, don't change the HTML code given.

<html>

<body>
  Animals:
  <ol id="ol1">
    <li>Frog</li>
    <li>Dog</li>
    <li>Bunny</li>
  </ol>

  <div id="id1">
    <p>This is the text in div id1</p>
    <p>Hope you enjoy my HTML</p>
  </div>

  <p id="id2">Here's some text in a paragraph</p>

  <div class="myClass">I love learning about HTML and JavaScript</div>

  <p class="myClass">Coding is fun</p>

  <button id="button1">Button 1</button>
  <br /><br />
  <button id="button2">Button 2</button>
</body>

<script type="text/javascript">
  // Exercise 1: Select the element with id "id2" and change the text inside it to "Here's some new text"
  document.getElementById("id2").textContent = "Here's some new text";

  // Exercise 2: Select the element with id "id1" and make the text inside it green.
  document.getElementById("id1").style.color = "green";

  // Exercise 3: Select the elements that have the class "myClass". console.log the output.
  const myClassElements = document.getElementsByClassName("myClass");
  console.log(myClassElements);

  // Exercise 4: Select the children of the element with id "id1". console.log the output.
  const id1Children = document.getElementById("id1").children;
  console.log(id1Children);

  // Exercise 5: Select all list items on the page. console.log the output.
  const listItems = document.querySelectorAll("li");
  console.log(listItems);

  // Exercise 6: Use JavaScript to find the *number* of list items on the page. console.log the output.
  console.log("Number of list items:", listItems.length);

  // Exercise 7: Using JavaScript, create a list item and add it to the end of the ordered list.
  const newItem = document.createElement("li");
  newItem.textContent = "Parrot";
  document.getElementById("ol1").appendChild(newItem);

  // Exercise 8: Using JavaScript, make it so that when button1 is clicked,
  // an alert pops up saying "Hi from Techtonica".
  const button1 = document.getElementById("button1");
  button1.addEventListener("click", function () {
    alert("Hi from Techtonica");
  });

  // Exercise 9: In your own words, write a few sentences explaining what the DOM is. Write your answer in a comment below:
  /*
  Q&A (Exercise 9)
  The DOM (Document Object Model) is how the browser represents an HTML page as objects
  and nodes that JavaScript can interact with. It lets us use JS to change text, styles,
  structure, and respond to user actions (like button clicks). The DOM is like a live map
  of everything in the page that JS can control.
  */

  // Exercise 10: Select the elements with the class "myClass" and update the text inside each of them to end with "!"
  // Hint: To operate on multiple elements, you can use a loop.
  for (let i = 0; i < myClassElements.length; i++) {
    myClassElements[i].textContent += "!";
  }

  // Exercise 11: Make it so when the button2 is clicked,
  // the children of the element with id "id1" each have their text replaced with a random number 1-100
  const button2 = document.getElementById("button2");
  button2.addEventListener("click", function () {
    const children = document.getElementById("id1").children;
    for (let i = 0; i < children.length; i++) {
      children[i].textContent = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;
    }
  });

  // How was this exercise (easy, hard, fun, confusing)?
  // What references did you use to help?
  // Please put your answers in a comment below:
  /*
  Q&A (End Reflection)
  This DOM exercise was fun! It helped me understand how HTML and JavaScript connect.
  The most interesting part was using query selectors and event listeners to make buttons interactive.
  I found it easy to visualize because changes appear instantly on the webpage.

  References I checked after trying on my own:
  - MDN Web Docs: getElementById(), querySelectorAll(), addEventListener().
  - W3Schools DOM tutorial for quick examples.
