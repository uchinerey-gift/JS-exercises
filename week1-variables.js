// Week 1 - Variables

// Exercise 1. Simply declare a variable named 'emptyVariable'
let emptyVariable;

// Exercise 2. Declare a variable called 'myName'
let myName;

// Exercise 3. Assign your name as the value for 'myName'
myName = "Chinerey";

// Exercise 4. Declare a variable called dreamDestination and give it the value
// of what your dream vacation destination is.
let dreamDestination = "Bali";

// Exercise 5. Make the following variables and assignments
// - a variable called num1 with a value greater than 1 and less than 10
// - a variable called num2 with a value of greater than or equal to 1 and less
//   than or equal to 10
let num1 = 5;
let num2 = 10;

// Exercise 6. Write a comment below explaining the difference between the rules
// for num1 and num2 from Exercise 5. What numbers would be valid values for
// num2 but not num1?
// num1 must be >1 and <10
// num2 can include 1 and 10
// So 1 and 10 are valid for num2 but not num1.

// Exercise 7. Now we will try some addition.
num1 = 4;
num2 = 6;
let theSum = num1 + num2;

// Exercise 8. Now we will try some multiplication.
let theProduct = num1 * num2;

console.log("Sum:", theSum);
console.log("Product:", theProduct);
